    <h1>History of my YouTube Channel</h1>
    
    <h1>Starting Up</h1>
    <h3>In 2015, I got my first ever console, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360">Xbox 360</a></h3>
    <h3>I was very into gameplay recordings and YouTube, and so in 2016, I got my recording device. The Elgato HD60. To this day, I still sometimes use it! I used the Elgato to make '360 videos for the next year.

      <h3>I uploaded my last '360 video on 13 Oct 2016. It was a gameplay on the game <a href="https://trueaxis.com/jetcarstunts.html">Jet Car: Stunts. The official link to the video is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNt7AGU238E">here.
